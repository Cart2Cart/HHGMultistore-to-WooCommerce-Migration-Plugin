== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can Cart2Cart migrate invoices? =
Cart2Cart doesn’t migrate invoices, but only orders. You target shopping cart will generate invoices automatically, if this function is available. In another case, you can generate invoices manually after migration is finished.

= Can I delete my Source Store data after migration? =
We highly recommend not to delete any of your entries (products, customers, orders, etc.) at the Source Store after full migration is completed. Since if you later on decide to use our Recent Data Migration Service we can't guarantee proper data transfer results.

= Can I migrate pictures from my database dump? =
While moving your store from a database dump image migration is not provided as a default feature. In order to transfer your pictures, you should grant us with an access to a folder with images. After the migration is finished we will upload them to your store.

= How to start work with Cart2Cart service? =
Cart2Cart is a SaaS so no software installation is necessary.
First of all make sure that your shopping cart is in the list of supported platforms. Cart2Cart supports over 40 popular shopping carts.
